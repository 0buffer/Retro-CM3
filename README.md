# Retro-CM3

Yet another retropie build. 

Build with Raspberry Pi Compute Module 3 Lite. As powerful as Rpi3B, but as small as Rpi 0.

The final size of this console is within 155x61x15mm with 2 hours batter life.

Support most of the emulators provided by retropie.

Run PS1 N64 smoothly, able to run most 2D and some of 3D PSP games.
